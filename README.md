A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. 
It is a polyform whose cells are squares. It may be regarded as a finite subset of the regular square tiling.

In this project we display the graph and the number of all fixed geometric figures of a polyomino depending on
the dimension that we want.

Run for example
python3 project.py -p 5

use -p if you want to view the graph . If you want to view only the number of fixed geometric figures
of the tetromino for ex you can run
python3 project.py 4
